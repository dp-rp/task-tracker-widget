# task-tracker-widget
A hacky widget that displays in-progress tasks from a central source of truth ticketing system (e.g. Azure DevOps work items)

## Purpose

I have ADHD, and I pretty often forget which task I'm working on when I context switch. My current project uses Azure DevOps as a ticketing system, and it's UX isn't convenient enough for me to open a browser tab every time - (a) I'd rather something faster and (b) opening a browser tab opens opportunities for distraction, which is the enemy when trying to be productive on a task.
